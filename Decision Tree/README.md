In this part, I will be demonstrating the Decision Tree: one of the most common and popular machine learning algorithms for classification problems.
First to understand the basic of decision tree, I strongly suggest you to go through the following link and have a clear concept about decision tree before going to the code part.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree-introduction-example/

Once have a clear concept then one can go through the "Decision Tree.ipynb" code file for understanding how the code works.
